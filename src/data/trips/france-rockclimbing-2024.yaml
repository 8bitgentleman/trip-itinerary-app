    title: Layover in Porto, Portugal
    description: >
      A surprise 12hr layover in Porto tured out to be one of the highlights of the trip. 
      Locked my bags at the airport and spent the day wandering around the city and ate at 
      the famous Majestic Cafe where JK Rowlings supposedly wrote parts of Harry Potter.

    title: Land in Paris
    description: >
      Headed to a climbing shop (not far from the Louve) to get fitted for gear then 
      started what turned out to be an 8hr chaotic saga of trying to rent a car and 
      then drive it through paris ðŸ˜‚. Picked up our stuff from the airBnB and drove to Avon to stay for the night.

    title: Normandy Cliffs
    description: >
      Drove a ton to get up to the cliffs of Normandy. Turned out it was some national 
      holiday in Normandy which made driving interesting... Hiked up and around the cliff then walked down the beach.
